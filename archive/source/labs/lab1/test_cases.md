# Lab 1 Test Cases

First, make them demo their code with their test program.  Question the absence of any edge cases.  I fill the first 50 words of RAM with 0xCCCC.  Then, set a break on END_PROGRAM.  Then, make them go through each result and trace it back to the original program.

## Required Functionality

0x11, 0x11, 0x11, 0x11, 0x11, 0x44, 0x22, 0x22, 0x22, 0x11, 0xCC, 0x55

Result: 0x22, 0x33, 0x00, 0x00, 0xCC

## B Functionality
