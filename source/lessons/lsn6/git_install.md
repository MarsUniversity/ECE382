# Git Install Instructions

You may need to run as Administrator.

1. Grab the git-bash package from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
    1. Take the default options, but there is a new one, see below:
    1. Something like the second window now asks if you want to install the
    nano text editor. I like nano, it is a very simple editor. Otherwise your
    default is vim, which is insanely complex and I personally dislike.
1. Now to open a bash window, you can double click on the git-bash icon on your desktop or from the start menu: All Programs -> Git -> Git Bash
