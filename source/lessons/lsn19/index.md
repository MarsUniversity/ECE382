# Homework

1. How many bytes are the following
    1. uint8_t
    1. int8_t
    1. int32_t
    1. uint16_t
1. What C header file do I have to include in my code to use boolean values?
1. Write the C code to disable the watchdog timer (you can do it in one line).
1. Why do I use the key word `volatile` on a variable like: `volatile uint8_t bob;`?
1. Why is `#define bob 10` not a good thing to do? *Hint:* it is better to do:
  `const uint8_t bob = 10;`, but why?
1. If I wanted to set the 3rd bit of `int8_t a`, how do I do that in C?
1. If I wanted to clear the 2nd bit of `int8_t b`, how do I do that in C?
