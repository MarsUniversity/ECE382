# Lab 4 Notes

- Note bash aliasing to move to lab directory

- Note `bis` and `bic` C constructs - `P1DIR |= BIT0`, `P1DIR &= ~BIT0`

- Note `P1DIR |= BIT0|BIT1|BIT2;` to set multiple in single command

- Note delay macro `_delay_cycles(100);`

- Note that assembly doesn't always map well to C line for line - your goal is to replicate function, not just translate.  Some technqiues that work well in assembly don't work well in C and vice-versa.

- Goal for first lesson - clear LCD!

- Note different strategies for string rotation and how to declare a string in RAM or RAM

- Not how to clone and include a library
