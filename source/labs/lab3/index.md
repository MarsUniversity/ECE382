# Lab 3 - Interrupts - "Remote Control Decoding"

## Objectives

- Using the timing peripheral
- Reverse engineer a protocol
- Use the capture compare peripheral
- Use interrupts
- Communicate with external hardware

In this lab, you'll use your knowledge of interrupts and the Timer_A subsytem to
reverse engineer a remote control.

## Handy References

- IR Receiver TSOP382 [datasheet](../../references/tsop382.pdf)

## Given code

- [test3.c](./test3.c) - Use this file to characterize the buttons of your remote
- [start3.c](./start3.c) - Initial template file for lab
- [start3.h](./start3.h) - Initial template file for lab
- [IR timing spreadsheet](./ir_remote.xlsx) - use this to help you characterize

your remote control pulses. You will look at data in CCS and find the start
of a signal, then copy/paste those values into the spreadsheet. The spreadsheet
will help you estimate pulse durations.

# Directions

You will need to use the timer interrupt and the general purpose pin interrupt
to decode a remote control.  Be sure to pick one remote for the whole lab, as
remote codes vary.

## Milestones

This lab will be completed in 3 steps:

- **Lab day 1:** Characterize the IR buttons: learn the timing and bit patterns for your remote control (*hint:* use the logic analyzer)
- **Lab day 2:** Use interrupts to capture IR packets: demonstrate your code can receive and decode button presses from the remote control
- **Lab day 3:** Demonstrate turning LEDs on/off

# Day 1

## Prelab 1

- Fill in the setup code for [start3.c](start3.c)

## Connecting the IR sensor

Insert the IR receiver module into the protoboard. Look at the datasheet and make
sure you are wiring up the receiver module correctly. When you are looking at
the sensor ball on your IR receiver module, the pin on the left is your signal
pin; the pin in the middle is your ground pin; and the pin on the right is
your Vcc.

![IR Sensor Datasheet excerpt](ir_sensor.jpg)

Hook up your launchpad to the IR module as shown in either picture:

![](launchpadSetup.jpg)

Or

![](lab-setup.png)

On your MSP430, connect:

- the signal pin to XIN/P2.6 on J2
- the ground pin to the GND pin on J6
- IR Vcc pin to Vcc on the MSP430.

When hooking up to the logic analyzer, remember to connect the MSP430 ground to
the logic analyzer ground. Also, hook the signal from the IR to one of the POD1
inputs.

## Timer Counts

Build a project around your modified `test3.c` and then download it onto your
LaunchPad. Make sure to open the variables tab (View -> Variables). I also like
to clear memory from the Memory Browser tab (View -> Memory Browser), Fill
Memory from 0x200 to 0x400 with 0's. Run the program and then press a button on
a remote. Then pause the program and look at the variables. You should see
something like the following.

![array screen shot](arrayScreenShot.gif)

The values are the captured wave form from the remote. Using this data the
IR timing spreadsheet, you need to determine the remote's timing

- Table-1

# Day 2

#### IR data packets

Before you start on this portion of the assignment, watch
[Dave Jones' Trigger Hold-off Tutorial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta096oBzSac).
You are going to need to use the logic analyzer to examine the IR waveforms
generated by a remote control of your choice.

Set up your LaunchPad like the picture below. Make sure to connect the power and
ground in the correct order! Connect the logic analyzer on the Vout pin of
the IR receiver.

Configure the logic analyzer to collect data on an edge change, with at least
90% of the data stored post-trigger.  On my remote control, the full remote
control signal was about 80ms. Please note that remote control data packets
are not standardized by any means, so the remote that you use to perform these
experiment will almost certainly generate results different  from those that
your neighbor's remote will generate.

List the lengths of the pulses generated by the remote control in absolute time
using the logic analyzer (3 significant figures) and in timer A counts.  
Note: "start -- logic 0 half pulse" refers to the logic LOW portion of the start
pulse, and "data 0 -- logic 1 half pulse" refers to the second half (which is a
  logic HIGH) of the pulse representing a zero bit.



Collect and tabulate in Excel eight samples of timer A counts for each of the
following pulse types (in decimal). Compute the average and standard deviation
of each pulse type. I would suggest just grabbing it from the CCS variables tab.

- Data 1, logic 1 half-pulse

- Data 0, logic 0 half-pulse

- Data 0, logic 1 half-pulse

Ensure you label the rows and columns of your table so that I will know what
the information in each cell means.

For each pulse type list the range of timer A counts that would correctly
classify 99.9999426697% of the pulses. This number has something to do with the
[standard deviation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation#Rules_for_normally_distributed_data)
(hint: look at the table in this section).

Write the codes (in hex) for at least 10 remote control buttons.  ("Button name"
refers to CH+, 6, VOL-, Power, etc.)

# Prelab

Hand in a flowchart of your program.

Answer the following questions:

1. How long will it take the timer to roll over?
1. How long does each timer count last?

The while(1) loop in main reads in the IR pulse in the for loop.

Annotate the picture below to indicate which line of the for loop in the program
is executed at which part of the pulse. You should show a total of 6 lines of
code (lines 32-34 and lines 36-38).

# Demonstrate Functionality on Day 3

Turn an LED on and off with one button on the remote (any button is fine). Turn
another LED on and off with a different button.  Turn both LEDs on and off with
a third button.
