# Using Other Robots

It is unacceptable to use the robots of other students without their permission. There is the potential for your code to break their robots and cost them time / frustration, which is selfish and unfair. This includes any example robot(s) in the lab.

You must demonstrate functionality on your own robot. If someone grants you permission to use their robot for troubleshooting purposes, that is acceptable. But all final demos must be with your own hardware.
